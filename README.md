# Background

# Preparation
  ## Hardware
  - **RAM is at least 4GB**: hybris itself needs at least 2GB to run. Linux requires 1GB to maintain the processes. Moreover, GPU would take few hundreds of MB despite of headless is being used.
  - **Has ethernet port**: Most of tvboxes are not running with wifi on Linux because of driver compatibility.
From above conditions we can choose the below SOCs:

||High-end|Medium|Cheap|
|-----|-----|-----|------|
|Gen 2|S922X|X905X2|X905W2|
|Gen 3||X905X3||
|Gen 4||X905X4||

==If you are owning a Tanix W2 (or any X905W2) with 4GB of RAM you are having same hardware specs I have done setting up.==
